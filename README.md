# 🤖 Chet - The Marketplace Negotiator

> "I made an AI that lowballs Facebook Marketplace sellers" - Michael Reeves

This extension is inspired by [Michael Reeves' hilarious video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwOITqr_fz4) where he created an AI to automatically lowball Facebook Marketplace sellers. If you've been wanting to recreate that chaotic energy, well... here you go! 😈

Chet is your personal AI negotiator that:
- Automatically detects item details on Facebook Marketplace
- Generates condescending, lowball offers (40-50% of asking price)
- Points out flaws in listings like you're doing them a favor
- Maintains a dismissive, busy tone that's subtly infuriating
- Sends messages automatically with one click
